# About
This project is aimed at creating an argumented reality climate simulation system to educate people on climate change. I wrote it in a few hours so the code is REALLY messy. It was made for my 8th grade science project.

# Dev
It is writen in Processing (https://processing.org) and uses an Xbox Kinect as a vision sensor. The Kinect measures the depth of the synthetic polymer in the ARCSS structure and reports this data to the program. It then renders it correctly and projects it onto the surface.
